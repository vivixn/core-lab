Okayyy, sooo…

<br><br> *Mozart’s 5th*<br><br>

 I have an idea of what I’d like to do to my HTML file, given what we’ve learned in class. <br>I was inspired by all the buttons we’d use and I personally do like buttons, so I decided <br>to make it so that the h2 subheading of “tensions” changes to the text of each paragraph <br>if you click on the button with that paragraph name. I don’t like the default font and want <br>to go with something more modern corporate tech-feeling because the article is a <br>foundational cyber-feminist text and the name Zadie just reminds me of Zadie Smith lol.

<br><br>

So, I haven’t had much experience with Javascript Like At All but I kind of have an idea <br>of how I’ll work this out… So…

<br><br>

Come with me along this process!

<br><br>

So I know that I want to change the subheading, which is “h2” and currently has the word <br>”tensions” in it. I first gave “h2” an Id of “subheading” so I can tell my JS file what <br>element exactly I want changed when I click my button. So I make a button on my index.html<br> page and name it “Paragraph1.” I named my on click function “changeSubHeadingInfo” <br>because that sounds pretty self explanatory and I just put all the info from paragraph 1 into <br>the brackets so it’ll show once the button is clicked. I don’t know 100% what the argument <br>“articleText” does but I just know that it shows the innerHTML/ text only when I set it equal <br>to something defined… Then, I changed the font family to Helvetica and the font colors to <br>pinks because #punk. 

<br><br>

I then make buttons for the three other paragraphs and set them all to the function <br>changeSubHeadingInfo. I might take a look at what a query selector is later… maybe…<br> I’m not sure how it differs from selecting an element by ID because we didn’t go over<br> it in class. We shall see. 

<br><br>

I’m trying to use onmouseover to change the font color of both the quotation and the title<br> but sometimes only the color of one changes. Certain colors work and certain ones don’t. <br>Sometimes the text under one ID changes but the other doesn’t. I’m not sure why this is.<br> I tried doing the camel hump thing and naming the color “redOrange” but it still doesn’t <br>change the color. Oh, I’m dumb. The color is orangered not redorange haha. 
<br><br>
	<img src="images/1.png" width="50%" height="50%">
	<br>
	<img src="images/2.png" width="50%" height="50%">
	<br>
	<img src="images/3.png" width="50%" height="50%">
	<br>
	<img src="images/4.png" width="50%" height="50%">
<br><br>

Okay. I think played with colors a bit more. And line breaks and stuff. (nvm. took them <br>out bc I couldn't figure out how to add them using JS...) I hope those aren’t breaking the <br>rules… Considering I somehow ended up breaking the rules forthe last two HWs even<br> though I promise I always read the entire email!!!
<br><br>
<h3>Confusions</h3>
<br>
One thing I'm still confused about is why is there a difference between doing 
<br><br><br>
In HTML:
<br> <br><br>
< body onmousemove="changeBackground('lavenderblush')" id="body">
<br><br><br>
In JS: 
<br><br><br>
function changeBackground(backgroundcolor){
<br>document.getElementById('body').style.backgroundColor=backgroundcolor;
<br>}
<br><br><br>
and 
<br><br><br>
In HTML: 
<br><br><br>
< h2 onmousemove="changeSubHeading('doineedthis')" id="subheading">tensions</h2>
<br><br><br>
and
<br><br><br>
In JS: 
<br><br><br>
function changeSubHeading(doineedthis){
<br> document.getElementById('subheading').style.fontFamily="helvetica";
<br><br><br>

<h2>Paul Ford’s “What is Code”</h2>

<p>
Um… So the page tracks how long I’ve been on the page and pops up on the corner… <br>Haha. Stalker. I think the introduction to this piece was very funny and sums up corporate<br> office life pretty pretty well. This line was especially funny “We are here because the <br>editor of this magazine asked me, ‘Can you tell me what code is?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘First of <br>all, I’m not good at the math. I’m a programmer, yes, but I’m an East Coast programmer,<br> not one of these serious platform people from the Bay Area.’” I agree and think even if<br> we are not natural coders, we should still learn the basics to be able to relay our thought <br>process to the actual developers and have a basic understanding of how code works. I <br>liked learning about the different variety of coding languages out there and it gives me <br>hope that I may become better at Javascript with practice even though it seems so <br>foreign now.
