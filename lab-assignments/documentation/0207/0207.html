Borscht 1.0 
</h4>
<p>
	If you donâ€™t make the borscht (or even if you do, perhaps while it is simmering), look <br>at some other recipes and think: does this recipe work in this format? What is the <br>trade-off for convention and novelty here? Are there some types of recipes that work <br>better one way than another? What does it mean for a recipe to work? What other kinds <br>of rules and instructions follow these kinds of structural conventions? What would it <br>mean if a recipe was a conversation? Or IKEA instructions? Or like a table with <br>chairs around it, indicating where you should sit?<br><br>

	I like recipes that are classically typeset. Borscht seems like a very homely, <br>traditional, old timey recipe, so I think that it would be out of my comfort zone to <br>make a recipe layout that looks super modern. I would like to make borscht one day, but <br>my schedule right now is just too too busy. I like recipes with ingredients on top; <br>this Guardian recipe just goes on forever before you can get to the actual recipe... <br>I think straight and to the point like IKEA instructions is very easy to follow.<br>
