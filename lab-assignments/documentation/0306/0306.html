Hi!

<br><br> 

I first changed the background color of the body element by using selecting the body <br> element and using JQuery to change the background color and text alignment to center <br> because I’m a love center aligned text. I changed the font family to Garamond.

<br><br>

I like using onmouseover and wanted to change the font color so I created a class “blue” <br> and  applied it to the “H1” “H2” and “block quote” elements. I made the function change- <br> Background and applied it to all elements with the class “.blue” and used JQuery $ to <br> change the css properties of all the elements with class “.blue” by writing .css({“color”: <br> “blue”}) so that the font color of all things under the class “.blue” become blue.


<br><br>

I added a toggle function onmouseleave to the block quote but instead of toggling it just <br> disappears for some reason… 

<br><br>

I then added a blur filter to the body to give it a muted dreamy feeling because the text <br>speaks about virtual realities, and the confusion between fact and fiction, future and past.<br> 
I created some functions “onIt 1-4” so that the different paragraphs blur out a little more <br>as you scroll down the page. But I couldn’t figure out how to invert what I did and unblur <br>them. I struggled with that for a while. But the increasing blur adds to the confusion <br>that immersive digital realities can bring.
 

<br><br>

I created a button that would cause the block quote to toggle and I used the H2 element as <br> the text for the button.I added a border to the body element so it frames the text.


<br><br>

I want to later experiment with variables later so I am not confined to one color “blue” but <br> I can use a wider variety of general colors. But we shall see if I get to that. Next steps!

<h2>Eric Lippert How to Debug Small Programs</h2>

<p>
When I was in highschool, we had to take this class called intro to computer science and<br>
I absolutely hated it because it was so so SO very mathy... Then, my teacher suddenly quit <br>
to join the circus because she was sick of the burocracy (I can't spell, sorry!) She made <br>us bring a stuffed animal or rubber ducky to class everyday and if we didn't have it we <br>would get point deductions. We were to talk to our duckies whenever we weren't sure what <br>was wrong with our code so we could be less stressed and figure it out lol. I like the part <br>where Lippert suggests to write it down on paper because looking at every line and <br>analyzing its use may help you feel less anxious about the situation at hand and can make <br>the longer code look a lot less intimidating. Establishing a decoding methodthat works for <br>you can also help you become more systematic when debugging future things.
