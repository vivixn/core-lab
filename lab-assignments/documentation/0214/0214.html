Borscht 2.0 & Shay Howe's Writing Your Best Code
</h4>
<h2>Borscht 2.0</h2>
<p>
	I first tried lining all the different sections up top one next to another, but then, <br>I re-read the email and realized we couldn’t use flexbox, which is what I think <br>allowed for them to take on that position. I guess I will now take out flex and try <br>to make them all individual divs and place them across the page for the same effect... <br>Or just try out more different ideas.

<a id="link" href="../../borschtassignment2/borscht2.1/borscht2.11.html"> Version 2.1 </a><br><br>
Soooo, I decided to start over and do different stuff. So for version 2.1 I chose to play <br>around with the height of the HTML and body elements as well as setting the margin of <br>the body. I also defined the width, height, and float of the div so that I can use color<br> and other CSS elements later. For version 2.11, I took version 2.10 and added a gradient. <br>Each section was given a class and I used the CSS color codes to pick colors for each <br>div. I also chose to use text-align to center the text.

<a id="link" href="../../borschtassignment2/borscht2.2/borscht2.21.html"> Version 2.2 </a><br><br>
For version 2.2, I played around with the margins for each specific div.<br>
For version 2.21, I tried making the left and right margins of the divs random different <br>numbers so that the text would kind of be misaligned and I chose to make the text random <br>pastel colors just to see how the page would look. For 2.22, I also changed the font <br>family to Helvetica, the weight to lighter, and the font size to 5px. I think the page <br>makes the recipe look cute and sort-of elegant in a way.

<a id="link" href="../../borschtassignment2/borscht2.3/borscht2.31.html"> Version 2.3 </a><br><br>
For version 2.3, I chose to play around with float and clear and paired each div with <br>either float: right; clear: left, or float: left; clear: right so that they alternate on<br> the page and steer clear of each other. I also incorporated a dotted border that has an <br>increase in size with every div. Just for fun!<br><br>
I chose to apply the same gradient colors that I’d used previously to show the alternating <br>divs on the white page. And for the dotted border, I chose one side of the border per <br>div to give a color to, and I reversed the gradient for contrast.

<a id="link" href="../../borschtassignment2/borscht2.4/borscht2.42/1.html"> Version 2.4 </a><br><br>
For version 2.40, I chose to play around with links and followed a similar format from <br>the previous version. I chose to move all the style elements into a CSS style sheet so <br>each page that links to the next wouldn't be too long. For version 2.41, I chose to play <br>with a monospaced font and do a gradient on the border. The closer you get to the end <br>of the recipe, the brighter the color of the border gets.

<br><br>
<a id="link" href="../../borschtassignment2/borscht2.5/borscht2.52/1.html"> Version 2.5 </a><br><br>
For version 2.50, I chose to play around with float right and margins to create a cascading waterfall effect. <br> For version 2.52, I nested all the files and kept the cascading shapes and at the end the entire waterfall <br>is revealed. I kept the pastel color scheme from 2.2.

<h2>Shay Howe's Writing Your Best Code</h2>

<p>
Some important things from the reading I have to keep in mind: <br><br>
I think it is so tedious to always make new folders, and label things correctly, but it<br> pays off in the long run. If one folder is incorrectly labeled, for instance the title on <br>a CSS style sheet, then you'd have to go into every single HTML file you linked the <br>sheet on and change the title of the sheet. So I think good coding ettiquete is important<br> and it's better to be neat than to have to look through for errors later on.
<br><br>

<ol><li>
Use lowercase letters within element names, attributes, and values<br></li>
<li>Indent nested elements<br></li>
<li>Strictly use double quotes, not single or completely omitted quotes<br></li>
<li>Omit the values on Boolean attributes<br></li>
</ol>

<br>
Class names (or values) should be modular and should pertain to content within an <br>element, not appearance, as much as possible. These values should be written in such <br>
a way that they resemble the syntax of the CSS language. Accordingly, class names <br>
should be all lowercase and should use hyphen delimiters.
