			<h2><em>No &nbsp;kvas</em> &nbsp;–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>
		<p>
	
			Lesley Chamberlain gives a "modern Polish" recipe from Lwów, <em>"attributed to what <br>is now western Russia" – she loses me when she qualifies this by adding "in fact, <br>therefore, it is Ukrainian" (apparently the city, now Lviv, became part of the Ukraine <br>in 1944).</em> Confusing as this may be, what's interesting is that, instead of the sour beet-<br>root, she uses a mixture of sour cream and flour, added at the end of cooking time <br>to thicken the soup. I'm not keen on the raw flour flavour, and the creaminess of <br>the finished soup is at odds with my idea of borsch, however authentic it might be <br>if you happen to find yourself in Lwów / Lviv / Russia.
