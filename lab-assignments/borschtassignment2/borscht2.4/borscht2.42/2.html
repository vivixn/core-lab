			<h2><em>Simple</em> &nbsp;–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

		<p>

			Even amongst themselves, these writers disagree as to what constitutes a barszc: <br>it's generally acknowledged that there are as many different types as there are Poles <br>in the diaspora, but according to Lemnis, there are two principal varieties, one <br>vegetarian version for the Christmas Eve feast, and one made with meat stock for <br>Easter. Both, however, are made with what she calls <em>"naturally soured beet juice"</em>, a <br>kind of kvas, or fermented liquor, which fits with the Polish <em>(and Russian)</em> taste for<br> sweet and sour flavours identified by Lesley Chamberlain.
		<br><br>
			This isn't something I can lay my hands on, even after a tour of the many Polski<br> Skleps in my neighbourhood, so thank goodness the process is, apparently <em> "very <br>simple".</em> All you have to do is peel and thinly slice your beetroot, then cover them <br>with lukewarm water, pop a slice of rye bread on top and leave somewhere warm <br>for the best part of a week. <em>(I'd add to that, warn your flatmate before going out for <br>the evening.)</em>
		<br><br>

			After four days on top of the water heater, my bowl of beets has developed a satisfying <br>amount of foam, and a reassuringly unpleasant smell. Fortunately there's no sign of <br>the mould Maria Ochorowicz breezily suggests I might need to scrape off before<br> making her very simple take on barszcz.
		<br><br>
			After scooping the soggy bread out, I season the soup with salt, pepper and a pinch of <br>sugar, and then ladle some of the malodorous water into a bowl. Maria reckons it's <br><em>"sour and tasty".</em> I'm surprised it's not worse, but it would require some confidence <br>in one's ability to carry off peasant chic to serve this up to guests.<br>
