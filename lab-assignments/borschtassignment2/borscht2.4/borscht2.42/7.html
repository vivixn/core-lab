		<p>

			As we've seen, borscht recipes range from very simple beetroot broths to elaborate <br> preparations involving beans, potatoes and all sorts. I prefer the recipes which, like <br>Lindsay Bareham's, use potato to give the soup body; it seems to soak up the flavour<br> better than Lesley Chamberlain's white beans. I also approve of Lindsay's use of <br>cabbage, which not only gives the soup a bit of colour, but, to my mind, adds an air <br>of Eastern Bloc authenticity to proceedings.
		<br><br>
			Sweet, earthy parsnips, as suggested in some recipes, are too much with the beetroot, <br>and one has to be careful not to overload the dish with carrots for the same reason <br>– using leeks and celery makes for a more interesting bowl of soup. Many recipes use <br>tomatoes <em>(in fact, Lesley Chamberlain puts in a whole large tin, which robs her <br>soup of its vibrant pink colour)</em>, but I notice the older ones tend not to, and, on <br>reflection I don't think the dish gains much from these defiantly summery fruits.
