		<h1><em> How &nbsp;to&nbsp; Cook &nbsp;the &nbsp;Perfect &nbsp;Borscht </em> &nbsp;</h1> 


		<p>

			<h3><em> <li>Barszcz</li> <li>Barščiai</li><li>Borscht</li> </em></h3>
			- whatever you call it, does it need meat, or are simple vegetarian versions <br>
			truer to the spirit of the dish? And <em> (deep breath) </em> which country makes the best?	
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol>Calling this beetroot soup a Polish classic is as inflammatory as an <br>evening on the sliwowica – for a start, the name we generally know it <br>by in this country, borscht, is Russian. In Poland, it's barszcz, while in<br> Lithuania, they call it barščiai. From Sevastopol to Szczecin, they claim <br>the dish as their own, but I think Lesley Chamberlain, former Reuters <br>correspondent for Moscow and a woman who's found the time to write <br>two books on the food of the region in between works on Nietzsche, the <br>river Volga and the downfall of communism, puts it best, and most <br>diplomatically, with her description of a <em>"babble"</em> of Eastern European <br>recipes which makes it <em> "difficult to say which dish belongs where".</em></ol>

			What is certain is that beetroot soup is seen by many as <em> "the pride of old Polish <br>cooking" </em> as Maria Lemnis, author of a work on traditional Polish cooking refers <br> to it. The Old Warsaw Cookbook, meanwhile, stoutly asserts it is impossible to <br>imagine a Pole welcoming a guest with anything but barszcz – which should give <br>the aspiring traveller pause for thought.

		<p>

			Even amongst themselves, these writers disagree as to what constitutes a barszc: <br>it's generally acknowledged that there are as many different types as there are Poles <br>in the diaspora, but according to Lemnis, there are two principal varieties, one <br>vegetarian version for the Christmas Eve feast, and one made with meat stock for <br>Easter. Both, however, are made with what she calls <em>"naturally soured beet juice"</em>, a <br>kind of kvas, or fermented liquor, which fits with the Polish <em>(and Russian)</em> taste for<br> sweet and sour flavours identified by Lesley Chamberlain.
		<br><br>
			This isn't something I can lay my hands on, even after a tour of the many Polski<br> Skleps in my neighbourhood, so thank goodness the process is, apparently <em> "very <br>simple".</em> All you have to do is peel and thinly slice your beetroot, then cover them <br>with lukewarm water, pop a slice of rye bread on top and leave somewhere warm <br>for the best part of a week. <em>(I'd add to that, warn your flatmate before going out for <br>the evening.)</em>
		<br><br>

			After four days on top of the water heater, my bowl of beets has developed a satisfying <br>amount of foam, and a reassuringly unpleasant smell. Fortunately there's no sign of <br>the mould Maria Ochorowicz breezily suggests I might need to scrape off before<br> making her very simple take on barszcz.
		<br><br>
			After scooping the soggy bread out, I season the soup with salt, pepper and a pinch of <br>sugar, and then ladle some of the malodorous water into a bowl. Maria reckons it's <br><em>"sour and tasty".</em> I'm surprised it's not worse, but it would require some confidence <br>in one's ability to carry off peasant chic to serve this up to guests.<br>

			The other option, of course, is to fake it. Catherine Atkinson suggests in her survey <br> of Polish and Russian cooking, From Borsch to Blinis, that a respectable alternative <br>can be made by bringing a pan of grated beetroot, stock and lemon juice to the boil, <br>allowing it to sit for half an hour, and then straining. 
			<br><br>
			The resulting liquid has a less complex flavour than the real thing, but does the job of<br> adding tang to Catherine's soup,and at considerably less cost to one's airing cupboard.

			<h2><em>No &nbsp;kvas</em> &nbsp;–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>
		<p>
	
			Lesley Chamberlain gives a "modern Polish" recipe from Lwów, <em>"attributed to what <br>is now western Russia" – she loses me when she qualifies this by adding "in fact, <br>therefore, it is Ukrainian" (apparently the city, now Lviv, became part of the Ukraine <br>in 1944).</em> Confusing as this may be, what's interesting is that, instead of the sour beet-<br>root, she uses a mixture of sour cream and flour, added at the end of cooking time <br>to thicken the soup. I'm not keen on the raw flour flavour, and the creaminess of <br>the finished soup is at odds with my idea of borsch, however authentic it might be <br>if you happen to find yourself in Lwów / Lviv / Russia.

			<h2><em>Vinegar</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

		<p>

			To be fair, Lesley does suggest using the juice from pickled beetroot to improve the <br>colour of the soup, which has the virtue of imparting a certain piquancy, but goes <br>against Maria Lemnis' stern prohibition on the use of vinegar in borscht. Lindsay <br>Bareham also throws tradition to the winds in the recipe she gives in her book, A <br>Celebration of Soup – but then she also claims that borscht is <em>"originally from the <br>Ukraine,"</em> so her deployment of wine vinegar may be the least of Polish readers' <br>worries. I actually find I prefer the more assertive, yeasty tartness of vinegar to the <br>fresh citrussy note the lemon juice gave the soup, but after experimenting with <br>Bridget Jones' <em>(no, not that one)</em> suggestion in her book, Recipes from a Polish <br>Kitchen, I decide cider vinegar, with its slightly vegetal note, is even better.

			<h2><em>A &nbsp;question &nbsp;of &nbsp;stock</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

		<p>
	
			Most recipes I find call for beef stock – Lesley Chamberlain's makes use of the water <br> one cooks the soup's beans in, and Bridget Jones suggests that on Christmas Eve, fish <br>stock would be used instead, to honour the customary fast. The Old Warsaw Cookbook, <br>however, mentions a Lenten borscht based on a homemade vegetable stock, flavoured <br>with dried mushrooms. I'm not keen on the texture of the finished soup, which is <br>thickened with a roux, but I do like the foresty flavour the fungi bring to the table – <br>beetroot needs something richer and more savoury than mere water to counteract its <br>sweetness.For those keeping Lenten fasts <em>(as I'll be by the time you read this)</em> it's a nice <br>alternative – simply substitute a simple vegetable stock, made with dried mushrooms, <br>for the same amount of beef stock in the recipe below.

			<h2><em>Vegetables</em> &nbsp;–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

		<p>

			As we've seen, borscht recipes range from very simple beetroot broths to elaborate <br> preparations involving beans, potatoes and all sorts. I prefer the recipes which, like <br>Lindsay Bareham's, use potato to give the soup body; it seems to soak up the flavour<br> better than Lesley Chamberlain's white beans. I also approve of Lindsay's use of <br>cabbage, which not only gives the soup a bit of colour, but, to my mind, adds an air <br>of Eastern Bloc authenticity to proceedings.
		<br><br>
			Sweet, earthy parsnips, as suggested in some recipes, are too much with the beetroot, <br>and one has to be careful not to overload the dish with carrots for the same reason <br>– using leeks and celery makes for a more interesting bowl of soup. Many recipes use <br>tomatoes <em>(in fact, Lesley Chamberlain puts in a whole large tin, which robs her <br>soup of its vibrant pink colour)</em>, but I notice the older ones tend not to, and, on <br>reflection I don't think the dish gains much from these defiantly summery fruits.

			<h2><em>Flavourings</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

		<p>

			The six cloves of garlic that go into Lindsay Bareham's soup are a very welcome <br>addition, as far as I'm concerned – because they're tossed into the pan raw, they add <br>the kind of fiery heat which I associate with other typically Eastern European favourites, <br>like vodka and horseradish, both of which would make a fine accompaniment to the <br>finished dish. Maria Lemnis suggests black peppercorns, allspice and a bay leaf; a <br>mixture of hot and sweet flavours which seems appropriate; beetroot has such an <br>assertive flavour that it will take over the entire meal given half a chance, which I<br> think would be a shame. It should be the star here, but it needs some supporting actors <br>to point up its virtues.
		<br><br>
			Borscht should be a hearty, yet sophisticated dish: a bowlful of sweet, sour and <br>savoury flavours, rather than simply a vehicle for beetroot. It takes a bit of work – <br>but with a dollop of rich sour cream, and a sprig of aromatic dill, it's one of the <br>world's great soups. No wonder everyone wants to claim it as their own. Serve with <br>thick sour cream, sweet dill, and mushroom dumplings or hunks of black bread.

			<h2><em>Perfect &nbsp;borscht</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>
			<h2><em>Serves&nbsp; 4</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>


		<p>

		<ol>
			<li><ul>50g butter<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>1 small onion, 1 small carrot, 1 stick of celery, 1 small leek, all peeled where <br>necessary and cut into small dice or rings<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>2 grains allspice<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>½ bay leaf<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>1.5l gelatinous beef stock<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>2 medium floury potatoes, eg Maris Piper, peeled and cut into small dice<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>½ small cabbage, shredded<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>2 tbsp cider vinegar<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>1 tsp sugar<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>½ tsp ground black pepper<br></ul></li>
			<li><ul>Sour cream and fresh dill, to serve (preferably Polish sour cream, which has a <br>richer flavour)</ul></li>
		</ol>
			
 		<ol><br><br>
			1. Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice <em> (you may want to wear rubber gloves to <br>do this) </em> and set the rest aside. Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the <br>onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.
		<br><br>
			2. Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to <br>coat with butter. Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables <br>begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the remaining beetroot.
		<br><br>
			3. Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then add <br>the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot. Cook until all the vegetables are tender <br><em>(about 10 minutes).</em>
		<br><br>
			4. Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. Add a little more of <br>any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, <br>and some Polish bread on the side.
		<br><br>
			Is barszcz the best thing ever to come out of a beetroot, or a waste of a pair of <br>Marigolds? Does it need meat, or are simple vegetarian versions truer to the spirit of <br>the dish? And <em>(deep breath)</em> which country makes the best?
