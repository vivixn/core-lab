		<h1><em> How &nbsp;to&nbsp; Cook &nbsp;the &nbsp;Perfect &nbsp;Borscht </em> &nbsp;</h1> 


		<p>

			<h3><em> <li> Barszcz </li> <li> Barščiai </li> <li> Borscht</li> </em></h3>
			- whatever you call it, does it need meat, or are simple vegetarian versions <br>
			truer to the spirit of the dish? And <em> (deep breath) </em> which country makes the best?	
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol>Calling this beetroot soup a Polish classic is as inflammatory as an <br>evening on the sliwowica – for a start, the name we generally know it <br>by in this country, borscht, is Russian. In Poland, it's barszcz, while in<br> Lithuania, they call it barščiai. From Sevastopol to Szczecin, they claim <br>the dish as their own, but I think Lesley Chamberlain, former Reuters <br>correspondent for Moscow and a woman who's found the time to write <br>two books on the food of the region in between works on Nietzsche, the <br>river Volga and the downfall of communism, puts it best, and most <br>diplomatically, with her description of a <em>"babble"</em> of Eastern European <br>recipes which makes it <em> "difficult to say which dish belongs where".</em></ol>

			What is certain is that beetroot soup is seen by many as <em> "the pride of old Polish <br>cooking" </em> as Maria Lemnis, author of a work on traditional Polish cooking refers <br> to it. The Old Warsaw Cookbook, meanwhile, stoutly asserts it is impossible to <br>imagine a Pole welcoming a guest with anything but barszcz – which should give <br>the aspiring traveller pause for thought.
