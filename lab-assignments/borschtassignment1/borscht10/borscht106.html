			Most recipes I find call for beef stock – Lesley Chamberlain's makes use of the water <br> one cooks the soup's beans in, and Bridget Jones suggests that on Christmas Eve, fish <br>stock would be used instead, to honour the customary fast. The Old Warsaw Cookbook, <br>however, mentions a Lenten borscht based on a homemade vegetable stock, flavoured <br>with dried mushrooms. I'm not keen on the texture of the finished soup, which is <br>thickened with a roux, but I do like the foresty flavour the fungi bring to the table – <br>beetroot needs something richer and more savoury than mere water to counteract its <br>sweetness.For those keeping Lenten fasts <em>(as I'll be by the time you read this)</em> it's a nice <br>alternative – simply substitute a simple vegetable stock, made with dried mushrooms, <br>for the same amount of beef stock in the recipe below.
