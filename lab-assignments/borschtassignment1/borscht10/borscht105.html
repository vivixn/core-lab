			<h2><em>Vinegar</em> &nbsp;––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</h2>

			To be fair, Lesley does suggest using the juice from pickled beetroot to improve the <br>colour of the soup, which has the virtue of imparting a certain piquancy, but goes <br>against Maria Lemnis' stern prohibition on the use of vinegar in borscht. Lindsay <br>Bareham also throws tradition to the winds in the recipe she gives in her book, A <br>Celebration of Soup – but then she also claims that borscht is <em>"originally from the <br>Ukraine,"</em> so her deployment of wine vinegar may be the least of Polish readers' <br>worries. I actually find I prefer the more assertive, yeasty tartness of vinegar to the <br>fresh citrussy note the lemon juice gave the soup, but after experimenting with <br>Bridget Jones' <em>(no, not that one)</em> suggestion in her book, Recipes from a Polish <br>Kitchen, I decide cider vinegar, with its slightly vegetal note, is even better.
