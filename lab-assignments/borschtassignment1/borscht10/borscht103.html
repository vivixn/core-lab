			The other option, of course, is to fake it. Catherine Atkinson suggests in her survey <br> of Polish and Russian cooking, From Borsch to Blinis, that a respectable alternative <br>can be made by bringing a pan of grated beetroot, stock and lemon juice to the boil, <br>allowing it to sit for half an hour, and then straining. 
			<br><br>
			The resulting liquid has a less complex flavour than the real thing, but does the job of<br> adding tang to Catherine's soup,and at considerably less cost to one's airing cupboard.
