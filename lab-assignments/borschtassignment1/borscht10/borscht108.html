			The six cloves of garlic that go into Lindsay Bareham's soup are a very welcome <br>addition, as far as I'm concerned – because they're tossed into the pan raw, they add <br>the kind of fiery heat which I associate with other typically Eastern European favourites, <br>like vodka and horseradish, both of which would make a fine accompaniment to the <br>finished dish. Maria Lemnis suggests black peppercorns, allspice and a bay leaf; a <br>mixture of hot and sweet flavours which seems appropriate; beetroot has such an <br>assertive flavour that it will take over the entire meal given half a chance, which I<br> think would be a shame. It should be the star here, but it needs some supporting actors <br>to point up its virtues.

			Borscht should be a hearty, yet sophisticated dish: a bowlful of sweet, sour and <br>savoury flavours, rather than simply a vehicle for beetroot. It takes a bit of work – <br>but with a dollop of rich sour cream, and a sprig of aromatic dill, it's one of the <br>world's great soups. No wonder everyone wants to claim it as their own. Serve with <br>thick sour cream, sweet dill, and mushroom dumplings or hunks of black bread.
