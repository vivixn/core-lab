Firstly, I do admit that science fiction is my least favorite genre and it’s really hard for me to get <br>myself to sit down and read any type of speculative writing…I know that it’s good to be open <br>minded but to be completely honest, I might’ve unknowingly decided that I will not like these <br>short stories even before giving them a chance. Okay, now that I’ve written a disclaimer, I’ll go <br>read the short stories and come back to write what I think after. 
<br><br>
I first read Ted Chiang’s “The Tower of Babylon”, and as a Bible reader, I found the story to be <br>humorous and a bit satirical. I felt bad for Hillalum he was toiling in vain and becoming a crippled <br>old man for no good reason especially since their tower building efforts, which had already gone<br> on for centuries, would ultimately fail because heaven and earth are not two figures that may appear <br>at opposite ends of the tablet, and can never touch. To read about builders digging at the sky to <br>break through the “Vault of Heaven” in hopes that they could ascend to see the works of Yahweh<br> and so that Yahweh might descend to see the works of men, and to read about how so many families <br>live in this Mesopotamian “skyscraper” instead of on the actual ground God had created for men <br>to live on seems kind of funny and a tad bit silly. And their fear of hitting a reservoir and causing<br> a second deluge seems funny to me (although it actually ended up happening in this short story) <br>because God had said that he would not cause another deluge, haha. But I guess I could see where <br>their curiosity came from given the specific context in which they lived. I’d say I enjoyed this <br>reading but there may be more philosophical implications I’m not picking up on.
<br><br>
Borges’ “Library of Babel” is bizarre, dense, and super deep! Borges’ super mathematical description <br>of the library was so oddly specific and I couldn’t imagine it in my head even when I tried. It <br>is really terrifying to read about so many people committing suicide and being thrown down into a <br>bottomless void when unable to decipher some unknown language, or find a specific book containing <br>the answer to all answers? Perhaps this book serves as a metaphor and tells us that our understanding<br> of the world we live in is limited and that we should just live our lives without trying to figure out <br>what is beyond our comprehension because knowing everything about everything would be impossible. 
<br><br>
Ursula Leguin speaks of a 15-hour workweek in “A Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction.” Man, I wish we <br>could live off a 15-hour workweek here. That would leave so much time for personal development <br>and things like baking, sketching, photography, etc… Things we have no time for… Anyway, haha, <br>Leguin speaks of how the first devices made by humans may have been used to carry food and how <br>a novel is a bundle holding things together. Women really deserve more credit because it’s hard in <br>this misogynistic society. Anyway, Leguin’s idea is similar to the idea brought up in the hypertext <br>reading from last week.
<br><br>
I enjoyed these! Suprisingly! I'm glad you assigned them because I definitely wouldn't have picked <br>them up on my own.

<h4>Questions</h4>
What are your interpretations of Borges’ “Library of Babel”? Do you think that there exists a <br>“Librarian” to find and decipher the book containing the overall “truth” they’re all looking for? <br>

How do you think these readings relate to the web and what we are currently studying?
