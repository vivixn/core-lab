"You, the Users", Kalli Retzepi, “Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?”, Hito Steyerl
</h4>

<br>
<p>I find it fascinating that the people behind Apple’s WWDC 2018 Keynote event put so much emphasis on <br>words like “you,” “yours,” and “user”; the tone in which the text transcript is written somewhat serves to <br>manipulate tech users into believing that design behind human-machine interactions is largely “user-centered.”<br> “You, the Users” makes me question whether I, as a user, am really in charge of my interfaces and whether I<br> really have the freedom in choosing what I choose to consume. It’s interesting how Retzepi relates computers <br>to 60’s psychedelics, and I find that nowadays, we live in a reality where “screens constantly [beg] our <br>attention” and how our social-media feeds “keep [our] eyes and brains glued to their ethereally refreshing <br>spinners.” Just a week ago I was on the train and an old man, before getting up and exiting at his stop, had <br>congratulated me for “being the only one in the cart not glued to a stupid little screen.” I looked up to see <br>that indeed everyone else in my row was on their phone and I thought, wow! Yes, these technological <br>advancements do make our lives so much easier, and yes, it’s wonderful to be able to Google to my heart’s <br>content but there’s something eerie about the fact that people are glued so to their devices and send their <br>friends messages, memes, and videos when their friends are sitting right next to them on the same subway cart. <br>It’s kind of scary how “cheekbones are airbrushed just as whole cities pretend to be YouTube CAD tutorials.” <br>It’s ironic how Apple’s 1984 commercial speaks against a 1984 world because, these days, all I read on the <br>news has to do with facial-recognition, how we’re constantly being tracked, and how governments may now be <br>producing facial-recognition war machines and how instead of the locusts mentioned in the Bible we may face <br>swarms of tiny little killer drones in the near future. “Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?” speaks about “an <br>internet of things all senselessly ‘liking’ each other, reinforcing the rule of a few quasi-monopolies. A <br>world of privatized knowledge patrolled and defended by rating agencies. Of maximum control coupled with <br>intense conformism, where intelligent cars do grocery shopping until a Hellfire missile comes crashing down. <br>Police come knocking on your door for a download—to arrest you after ‘identifying’ you on YouTube or CCTV,” <br>and that is certainly the case already in many many many countries around the world. Users are certainly not <br>in charge of the interfaces they interact with, for companies only release what they see fit to release to the <br>public and they use specific rhetoric to put users at ease while not being much transparent at all with what <br>actually goes on.
