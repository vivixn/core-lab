Claire Evans’ Broad Band Chapter 10: Hypertext
</h4>

<br>
<p>
As a semi-avid reader, I really enjoy Claire Evans’ comparison between hypertexts and books. Evans <br>states, “any text referencing another is considered a form of hypertext: sequels, which begin where <br>the last page of the previous book left off; footnotes; endnotes; marginalia; and parenthetical <br>asides” (246). Evans’ metaphor helps me understand hypertexts by introducing it in a context I am <br>more familiar with. Similarly, Wendy Hall’s European History lesson on The Battle of Hastings helps <br>me understand hypertext as something that connects one point to another, something interactive and <br>interconnected. I am very amused to find out that Wendy Hall was appointed Dame Commander of the <br>Order of the British Empire in 2009, and how many of her colleagues hadn’t considered interactive <br>multimedia to be real computer science. Take that, colleagues! Although Hall’s work is somewhat closer <br>to humanities than classical programming, she was able to see a future dominated by dynamic <br>interconnected links which connected images, texts, and ideas. Although hypertext is undeniably super <br>important, as it placed value on the association between different documents on the internet, <br>Cathy Marshall, a California based hypertext researcher explains that “computer science has always <br>marginalized people that are interested in users” (264). I think that today, a greater number of <br>people are realizing that how and why data is linked is important in that it can be used when <br>researchers teach artificial intelligence and machines that don’t understand connections intuitively <br>how to interpret connections.

<h4>Questions</h4>
Why do you think that other areas of computer science may have seen a rapid decline in female <br>participation? What might’ve drawn women to hypertext?
<br><br>
Would it be possible to create a giant class project where we link all our web pages, projects, etc.<br>to each other? Haha. We can create some sort of our own Domesday Discs, haha.
