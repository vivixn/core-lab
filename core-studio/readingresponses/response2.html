Reinfurt Knuth Typography & Fuck Content
</h4>

<br>
<p>

Personally, I found the Knuth reading to be a bit challenging because it is filled with a whole lot of jargon <br> that is completely beyond me...  One of my good friends, Toma, however, majors in computer science and <br> mathematics with an emphasis on machine learning, and after showing him our assigned reading, he started <br> to tell me a lot of stuff about Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, and algorithms and software design <br> patterns. To be completely honest, as much as I respect Toma and wanted to listen to what he was saying, most <br> of this talk just went in one ear and flew right out the other… One thing I remember Toma saying, however, is <br> that he uses Latex to write his proofs and stuff, and even though it is a pain sometimes, he thinks that <br> working it all out makes things a lot more efficient in the long run. He also said that Computer Modern, a <br> family of typefaces developed by Donald Kunth, is his favorite because he uses it for typesetting mathy stuff. <br> It fascinates me that typography comes into play even with the large and super important sounding projects <br> Toma works on. Honestly, I tend to mostly associate typography with the somewhat narrow fields of social <br> media and advertising, which is kinda sad, and I am happy to have learned that typography is super important <br> in more tech-y fields as well.
<br><br> 
I found the argument made in Fuck Content to be a very intriguing one because quality content is becoming <br> increasingly hard to find nowadays and some people believe that design is reduced to “pure style, a bag of <br> dubious tricks” without deep content. Personally, I believe that design can be used to evoke emotions and to <br> make content more personal and impactful. I believe that even if a designer is given wack content to work with, <br> it is his job to, through design, adorn the content so that it becomes more meaningful. To be able to use <br> specific design treatments to revamp dull content is to be well-versed with design devices such as <br> “typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale, weight.” Designers often do not have the privilege of knowing <br> what specific content they are to design for, and I don’t think that it is in our right to always request <br> this content. Designers should be able to work with what they are given and should be allowed to create some <br> ornate and jeweled crystal goblet if the wine inside is a wack wine because wine-drinkers may then be <br> manipulated into thinking the bad wine is actually kinda good. But this is also problematic in some senses, as <br> design can be used to promote fake news, etc. Ugh, now, after thinking about it, I think it’s like a no win <br> situation.
<br><br>
<h4>Questions</h4>
Do you find it problematic that designers can “adorn” bad content and manipulate users into thinking that the <br>content they’re consuming is more legitimate than it actually is? In what scenarios would this be acceptable or <br>unacceptable?
<br><br>
Why does TeX work better for mathematics, science, and computer science than let’s say… Helvetica? I don’t <br>quite understand.
