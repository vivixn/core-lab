Metalogue Why a Swan & Metaphors We Live By
</h4>

<br>
<p>
A metalogue is a conversation about a problematic subject where the form, structure, or manner in <br> which the dialogue is written conveys something about the problem discussed. This metalogue is<br>  super philosophical and I don’t know if I’m reading it correctly but Bateson and his daughter begin <br> Why a Swan by discussing two very cool ballets: Swan Lake and Petrushka, and why Tchaikovsky<br>  and Stravinsky chose to make the main characters of their works a swan and a puppet. I think that <br> when I watch ballet, I am so intrigued by ballerinas’ movements and how all the visual patterns on <br> stage seemingly come together so effortlessly that I kind of forget that the characters are played<br>  by humans. Although the ballerina who dances the role of Odette in Swan Lake literally wears the <br> same costume as the other ballerinas on stage, except for the fact her tutu may be slightly bigger <br> and that she wears a swan crown on her head, my imagination makes it so that the ballerina is more <br> of a swan-like character than she actually is. Having an experienced ballerina dance the role of<br>  a swan or of a puppet personifies those characters because the humans behind the roles bring <br> emotion and “life” to their characters by means of their dancing abilities and expertise. They are <br> able to, through dance, make the swan and puppet appear to be simultaneously inanimate and human. <br> The characters retain the essence of the original inanimate swan and puppet while the dancers behind <br> those characters bring more “humanity” to the character through specific lyrical bird-like or <br> puppet-like dance moves which may evoke the audiences’ emotions. It is kind of magical how ballets <br> come together; it is up to both the dancers, through their craft, and the audience, through the works<br>  of their imaginations, to make characters in ballets, plays, etc. appear more human than they <br> actually are. 
<br><br>
The relationship between a composer, the audience, and the main character, is similar to the <br>relationship between designers, content consumers, and websites. Composers work with<br> choreographers and choose to have experienced ballerinas dance the main parts because they are <br>aware that lyrical dancing influences viewers so that they relate to the characters and, through <br>imagery, see them tobe more human than they actually are. This would incline audience members <br>to continue watching ballets.Designers design eye-catching web-based content that appeals to <br>consumers’ subconscious needs and so consumers are somehow more emotionally inclined to <br>purchase the products being marketed/ dwell on these websites. 

<br> <br> 
Now, onto Metaphors We Live By... I find culture to be fascinating and it is really interesting how <br> even seemingly mundane  everyday greetings can vary so much across cultures. It’s weird and cool <br> at the same time how I had to train myself to give hugs and kisses, how I now have to remind myself <br> it’s not culturally appropriate to give hugs and kisses to some people , and how I find myself <br> sometimes backing up when guy friends from let’s say Spain give me the double kiss greeting. “In <br> general, which values are given priority is partly a matter of the subculture one lives in and partly<br>  a matter of personal values. The various subcultures of a mainstream culture share basic values <br> but give them different priorities” (Lakoff & Johnson, 23). Lakoff and Johnson give the example <br> of how to some people, bigger is better may conflict with there will be more in the future. Some <br> may choose to buy a big car right away while others may choose to buy a smaller, cheaper car so that<br>  they’d have an easier time paying it off later on. This is similar to how Chinese people <br> stereotypically save up money instead of spending it right away. And I read an article recently about <br> how Germans save up too much money… like $15 or something. And I also hear that people of my <br> generation are very impulsive when making purchases and no longer know how to save up… So it’s<br>  really interesting to think that metaphors may not all be perceived in the same way and the way <br> they’re interpreted depends on one's culture and values.
<br><br>
Metaphors such as these can be applied to websites because designers want to market their websites <br>to specific target audiences. And some metaphors or design decisions may offend certain groups of <br>people. This can be often seen in fashion, where some clothes or patterns may be labeled as cultural<br> appropriation. So designers have to be aware of cultural implications and biases when designing. 
<br><br>
<h4>Questions</h4>

Can someone explain to me the part about Catholic and Protestants and metaphors vs. <br> sacraments? Do Catholics believe that bread is actual flesh and wine is actual blood? I know that it <br> relates but I don’t understand how that relates to ballet characters being “sort of human”
<br><br>
What are some metaphors that may be interpreted differently across cultures?
